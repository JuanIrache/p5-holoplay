# p5-holoplay-2d-sample-project

Modify this project to create your own, or use the _sketch.js_ it for reference.

To get the project ready, run

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

That will install the necessary dependencies and build the necessary _bundle.js_ with them and the sketch.

Then open _index.html_ with your browser or, ideally, run it through a live server so that changes to _sketch.js_ are reflected automatically in your browser and device.

Make changes to _sketch.js_ to generate your Looking Glass holograms with p5.
