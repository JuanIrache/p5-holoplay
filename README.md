Experiments for using 2D p5js drawing in Looking Glass devices, specifically the Portrait

# TODO

- Why first frame is not fully drawn?
- Optimise stuff somehow? Maybe compress canvas?
- Visualise depth in visible canvas
- Import p5 properly in module, then return p+device
- Test with high density streens (mac and win)
- Create Quilt
- Send quilt as PNG efficiently
- Redraw
- Implement options like adjustSize and adjustPosition
- Option to visualize depth on visible canvas or not
- Maybe check if last message was confirmed by holo before sending the next?
- Document
- Use error codes
- Distribute as sample project + library
- "Report message proble"
