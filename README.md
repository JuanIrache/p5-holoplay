Experiments for using 2D p5js drawing in Looking Glass devices, specifically the Portrait

# TODO

- Distribute as sample project + library
- Document
- See if it works as a module or imports need to be adjusted
- Optimise stuff somehow? Converting the canvas takes time, and HoLoCore takes time to receive it and confirm
- See if we can use p5 frameCount, frameRate, etc.
- Maybe check if last message was confirmed by holo before sending the next?
- Implement more p methods (onMouse, etc) or indicate to set them in setup?
- Report "message" problem
