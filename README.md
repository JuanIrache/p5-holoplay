Experiments for using 2D p5js drawing in Looking Glass devices, specifically the Portrait

# TODO

- Implement options like adjustSize and adjustPosition
- Option to visualize depth on visible canvas or not
- Why first frame is not fully drawn?
- Document
- Improve index.html script structure
- Distribute as sample project + library
- Optimise stuff somehow? Converting the canvas takes time, and HoLoCore takes time to receive it and confirm
- Visualise depth in visible canvas
- See if we can use p5 frameCount
- Import p5 properly in module, then return p+device
- Test with high density streens (mac and win)
- Maybe check if last message was confirmed by holo before sending the next?
- Implement more p methonds (onMouse, etc) or indicate to set them in setup?
- Report "message" proble
