# p5-holoplay-2d-sample-project

Modify this project to create your own, or use the _sketch.js_ it for reference.

To install the project dependencies, run

```shell
npm install
```

Then for development work, run

```shell
npm start
```

This will open a live server with your sketch and refresh it if any changes are made to it.

Make changes to _sketch.js_ to generate your Looking Glass holograms with p5.

Then for production, run

```shell
npm run build
```

And place the files on a server.
